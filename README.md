# leo-acl2-bin

This repo contains binary bundles built in `leo-acl2`, uploaded as releases.  This file records the releases.

As of 2021-08-07, the `leo-acl2` repo is private, and the build process is idiosyncratic.  The plan is to improve the `leo-acl2` build and make the repo public, with its own releases.  Once that is done this `leo-acl2-bin` repo can be removed.
